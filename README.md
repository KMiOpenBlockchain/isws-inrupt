# isws2022-inrupt
 inrupt code library for the ISWS 2022 demonstrator 
 
This is a small library that has functions for the demonstrator to login a person into their Solid pod and read and write files/content from the demonstrator to their pod through [https://broker.pod.inrupt.com](https://broker.pod.inrupt.com).
 
It is based on the Inrupt tutorials on how to login to a Solid pod, [https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/tutorial/authenticate-browser/](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/tutorial/authenticate-browser/), and how to read/write files to a pod, [https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/tutorial/read-write-files/](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/tutorial/read-write-files/).
